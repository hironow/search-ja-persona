# Next Person Handoff

## Current State
- `uv run pytest` now executes all tests, but any cases hitting Docker-backed emulators fail in this sandbox: docker socket operations (e.g., `docker.from_env()` ping, TCP calls to localhost emulator ports) raise `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted`.
- Dataset CLI work is finished: unit tests for `search_ja_persona.cli` pass (`tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_persona_services.py`).
- `python-dotenv` is installed (per user note) so repository tests importing it succeed.
- Dev dependency list in `pyproject.toml` is back to the original values (no `docker` pin).
- Added `pytest.importorskip("docker")` guards to docker-dependent emulator tests to allow graceful skip when docker resources are unavailable, but tests still attempt real connections and thus fail after skip? â†’ guard only protects import level; the tests still try to talk to Docker after import, triggering permission errors.

## TODO / Recommendations
1. Decide how to handle emulator integration tests locally:
   - Option A: Run under an environment with Docker access (ensuring `docker.sock` permissions and emulator containers are up via `./emulator/start-emulators.sh`).
   - Option B: Add runtime guards (e.g., fixtures that skip when docker daemon or emulator ports are unreachable) so CI senza docker gets skips rather than failures.
2. Confirm whether the new CLI should wire into existing tooling (maybe add just targets or docs once tests are green).
3. If going with Option B, extend each docker-using test to call a helper that checks `docker.from_env()` inside `try/except` and calls `pytest.skip(...)` on `DockerException`/`PermissionError`.
4. After addressing Docker connectivity, re-run `uv run pytest` to ensure a clean pass (or clean skip set) before committing.

## Quick Reference
- CLI entry: `uv run python -m search_ja_persona.cli`.
- Relevant new files: `search_ja_persona/cli.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`.
- Plan reset already completed.
